#EMPHASIS EPIC analysis plan
##Overall objectives

Perform epigenome-wide methylation profiling of our Indian and Gambian child cohorts using the Illumina EPIC beadchip. The
analysis has three main aims; 1. to characterize nutritional intervention-associated methylation differences, 2. associate
these intervention-associated differences in methylation with the measured health outcomes, 3. investigate outcome-associated
methylation independent of intervention. We might also wish to explore: 4. the relationship between intervention and outcomes
independent of methylation status (TBD).
