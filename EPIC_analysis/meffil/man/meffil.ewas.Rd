\usage{
meffil.ewas(beta, variable, covariates = NULL, batch = NULL,
  weights = NULL, cell.counts = NULL, isva0 = T, isva1 = T,
  winsorize.pct = 0.05, most.variable = min(nrow(beta), 50000),
  featureset = NA, verbose = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{beta}{Methylation levels matrix, one row per CpG site, one column per sample.}

\item{variable}{Independent variable vector.}

\item{covariates}{Covariates data frame to include in regression model,
one row per sample, one column per covariate (Default: NULL).}

\item{batch}{Batch vector to be included as a random effect (Default: NULL).}

\item{weights}{Non-negative observation weights.
Can be a numeric matrix of individual weights of same dimension as \code{beta},
or a numeric vector of weights with length \code{ncol(beta)},
or a numeric vector of weights with length \code{nrow(beta)}.}

\item{cell.counts}{Proportion of cell counts for one cell type in cases
where the samples are mainly composed of two cell types (e.g. saliva) (Default: NULL).}

\item{isva0}{Apply Independent Surrogate Variable Analysis (ISVA) to the
methylation levels and include the resulting variables as covariates in a
regression model (Default: TRUE).}

\item{isva1}{Apply Independent Surrogate Variable Analysis (ISVA) to the
methylation levels, covariates and \code{isva0} variables and include
the resulting variables as covariates in a regression model (Default: TRUE).}

\item{winsorize.pct}{Apply all regression models to methylation levels
winsorized to the given level (Default: 0.05).  Set to NA to avoid winsorizing.}

\item{most.variable}{Apply Independent Surrogate Variable Analysis to the
given most variable CpG sites (Default: 50000).}

\item{featureset}{Name from \code{\link{meffil.list.featuresets}()}  (Default: NA).}

\item{verbose}{Set to TRUE if status updates to be printed (Default: FALSE).}
