Each column of y must be numeric.
In cases where a column of x contains factors,
the y-values for each factor level is compared
to the set of all y-values that are not outliers.
Outliers are identified as those below 1.5
times the inter-quartile range below the first quartile
or 1.5 times the inter-quartile range above the third quartile.}
