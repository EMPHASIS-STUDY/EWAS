\title{Test normalized betas for association with known batch variables}
\usage{
meffil.plot.probe.batch(norm.objects, pcs,
  variables = guess.batch.vars(norm.objects), additional = NULL,
  batch.threshold = 1e-50, cols = NULL, verbose = T)
}
\arguments{
\item{norm.objects}{Output from \code{\link{meffil.normalize.quantiles}()}.}

\item{pcs}{Output from \code{\link{meffil.methylation.pcs}()}
applied to the normalized methylation matrix
corresponding to \code{norm.objects}.}

\item{variables}{Default = guess.batch.vars(norm). Which variables in sample sheet to test}

\item{additional.}{Default = NULL. Data frame containing variables to test for association
with control matrix PCs. Must have \code{nrow(additional) == length(norm.objects)}.}

\item{verbose=T}{Print progress messages?}
}
\value{
List of table of results and graph
}
\description{
Performs association of each of \code{n} PCs calculated from most variable CpG sites (after normalization) against each of \code{m} measured batch variables
