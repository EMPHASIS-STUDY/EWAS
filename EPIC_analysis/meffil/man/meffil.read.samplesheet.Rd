\title{Function to read Illumina "Sample Sheet" adapted from \code{read.450k.sheet} in \code{R/minfi}}
\usage{
meffil.read.samplesheet(base, pattern = "csv$", ignore.case = TRUE,
  recursive = TRUE, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{base}{The base directory from which the search is started.}

\item{pattern}{= "csv$" What pattern is used to identify a sample sheet file, see \code{list.files}}

\item{ignore.case}{= TRUE Should the file search be case sensitive?}

\item{recursive}{= TRUE Should the file search be recursive, see \code{list.files}?}

\item{verbose}{= TRUE Should the function be verbose?}

\item{basenames}{Output from \code{\link{meffil.basenames}}}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} containing the columns of all the sample sheets. 
As described in details, a column named \code{Sentrix_Position} is renamed 
to \code{Array} and \code{Sentrix_ID} is renamed to \code{Slide}.  In addition 
the \code{data.frame} will contain a column named \code{Basename}.
}
\description{
Reading an Illumina methylation sample sheet, containing pheno-data 
information for the samples in an experiment.
}
\details{
This function search the directory \code{base} (possibly including
subdirectories depending on the argument \code{recursive} for
\dQuote{sample sheet} files (see below).  These files are identified
solely on the base of their filename given by the arguments
\code{pattern} and \code{ignore.case} (note the use of a dollarsign to
mean end of file name).#' 

In case multiple sheet files are found, they are all read and the
return object will contain the concatenation of the files.

A sample sheet file is essentially a CSV (comma-separated) file
containing one line per sample, with a number of columns describing
pheno-data or other important information about the sample.  The file
may contain a header, in which case it is assumed that all lines up to
and including a line starting with \code{\[Data\]} should be dropped.
This is modelled after a sample sheet file Illumina provides.  It is
also very similar to the \code{targets} file made used by the popular
\code{limma} package (see the extensive package vignette).#' 

An attempt at guessing the file path to the IDAT files represented in
the sheet is made.  This should be doublechecked and might need to
manually changed.
